Framework Design:
I have built a BDD framework to automate the rest services which are built for the application.

Technologies:
Language: Java
Built With: Maven
REST Assured
TestNG
Cucumber

SetUp:
To run this project, import the project and download the dependencies mentioned in the pom.xml file of the Project

Running the tests:
run all: tests
        mvn test

with tags:
        mvn test -Dcucumber.options="--tags @success"
tags : @success, @schema


Where to check reports:
Reports will be generated on below path 
APITest/target/cucumber-reports/cucumber-jvm-reports/cucumber-html-reports/
* overview-features.html

Where to check logs:
The logs are logged under log folder at below path
src\test\log

Found below observation while testing the api:
Observations:
1. Call does’t fails when username or any input value is given wrong and it returns empty response
2. Protocol used is https ,Currently it works with both http and https
3.If we hit the same request again for Delete, the message  should be returned as “The requested resource does not exist.” with status code as 404.
But here 200 OK is fetched as Status even after hitting the request for more than one
